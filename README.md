It looks like you have placed the routes for fetching all appointments inside the `ApplicationController` class. However, the routes for appointments should be defined in the `AppointmentsController` class instead.

Here's what the correct structure should look like:

1. `application_controller.rb`:

```ruby
class ApplicationController < Sinatra::Base
  set :default_content_type, 'application/json'

  # Require necessary gems and libraries
  require 'sinatra/base'
  require 'sinatra/activerecord'

  # Require your controllers
  require_relative 'patients_controller'
  require_relative 'appointments_controller'
  require_relative 'doctors_controller'
  require_relative 'departments_controller'
  require_relative 'categories_controller'
  require_relative 'invoices_controller'

  # Your application settings and configuration can go here

  # Optionally, you can add some helpers or middlewares here

  # Optionally, you can also set a layout or other settings here

  # Run the application
  # Only if running the app directly (not when running tests)
  # run! if __FILE__ == $0
end
```

2. `appointments_controller.rb`:

```ruby
class AppointmentsController < Sinatra::Base
  set :default_content_type, 'application/json'

  # GET route to fetch all appointments
  get "/appointments" do
    appointments = Appointment.all
    appointments.to_json
  end

  # POST route to create a new appointment
  post "/appointments" do
    appointment = Appointment.create(
      appointment_date: params[:appointment_date],
      start_time: params[:start_time],
      # Add other attributes for the Appointment model here
    )
    appointment.to_json
  end

  # PUT route to update an existing appointment
  put "/appointments/:id" do
    appointment = Appointment.find(params[:id])
    appointment.update(
      appointment_date: params[:appointment_date],
      start_time: params[:start_time],
      # Add other attributes for the Appointment model here
    )
    appointment.to_json
  end

  # DELETE route to delete an appointment
  delete "/appointments/:id" do
    appointment = Appointment.find(params[:id])
    appointment.destroy
    { message: "Appointment deleted successfully!" }.to_json
  end
end
```

With this structure, the routes for fetching all appointments will be correctly defined in the `AppointmentsController` class, and you should be able to access them at `http://localhost:9292/appointments`. Remember to restart your server after making these changes.
